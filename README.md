## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Our development branches are like this:
* `feature` is for adding, refactoring or removing a feature
* `bugfix` is for fixing a bug
* `hotfix` is for changing code with a temporary solution and/or without following the usual process (usually because of an emergency)
* `test` is for experimenting outside of an issue/ticket

***Always push changes to `dev`, not main***

For an example, you want to add a new feature, then create a new branch `feature/new-feature` and do your work - when you are finished, push to `dev`
